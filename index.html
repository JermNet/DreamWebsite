    <h1>What In The Heck Is This?</h1>
    <p>
      Long story short, I have a lot of dreams, so I write them down, and I thought it would be fun to share them. Some of them are interesting, some, not so much, and I don't even know if others are interested in this sort of thing, but I am, and that's enough, I guess.

    <h1>Rankings</h1>
    <p>
      It might seem a bit strange, but I rank my dreams out of 10. I think it's worthwhile though since some dreams are just better than others, no question. In terms of what I'm basing the rankings on, it's mostly just about how much I enjoyed the dream, but creativity, uniqueness, and how much a dream has inspired me to do something are important too. Still, the rankings are just kind of a way to make things slightly more interesting since dreams are kind of hard to quantify in the first place.

    <h1>Glossary</h1>
    <p>
      A lot of my dreams have elements specific to me, my life, and/or my interests. Because of this, I decided to make a glossary of these things so I don't either have to keep repeating myself or have most dreams not have clear visuals. Glossary entries are a mix of things from my life, and things from the internet/media in general, so that means there are two ways of handling them. Things from my life will typically be described in reasonable detail and that's it, with the exception of layouts of buildings which will be supplemented with a layout image. Things from the internet/media in general will almost always have an image, and will have shorter descriptions, but with a link to Wikipedia or something similar for more information. I would also like to note that diagrams aren't to scale, and mostly for getting the layout of a space across.

    <h1>Real Life People And Locations</h1>
    <p>
      For the sake of my friends, family, and myself, I don't use the real names of people or most places. For my family, I just refer to them as their familiar role (e.g., "Mom", "Dad", "Brother", etc.). Same for specific locations, like my house and the schools that I went to. For my friends though, I've come up with fake names. That might not be necessary since I could just use first names, but some of them have some unique names, and I still will be going into my country of origin (Canada!) as well as regional chains, so I wanted to play it safe. Also, this should go without saying, but none of these dreams are real, and everything that happens in them is pure fiction.

    <h1>The Styles of This Website</h1>
    <p>
      Yeah, this styles of this are a bit jank, but I like them. I wanted that weird vibe of dreams to come out in the style of this website at least a little bit. My dreams are funky more often than not, so this styling made the most sense to me, designers be damned. I feel like I often over scope in terms of what I want my website to do, so there's that too. But long story short, this website is every designer's worst nightmare (pun intended), and that's on purpose.
